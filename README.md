Pomodoro Tracker
================

A MEAN Stack application based off the Pomodoro Technique designed to help you be more productive. Pomodoro Tracker was a personal project I built while studying at Dev Mountain in Utah, you can find (and play around with) the live hosted version here: http://pomtracker.com/

The idea behind this app is simple. Pomodoro Tracker allows you to use a simple countdown timer and automatically track your Pomodoro (focused 25 minute work sessions) over given time periods. It then allows you to visualize that data in numbers and graphs. In addition, users are able to customize a personal profile page (including Amazon s3 image uploading) as well as view other users' profile pages and optionally "follow" other users.

This app is still in development but is currently live and functional and was constructed with the following technologies: AngularJs, NodeJs, MongoDb, ExpressJs, jQuery. I also designed the app layout myself and coded the design using 100% custom CSS. In addition, I incorporated a couple of extra technologies/features, namely Amazon s3 image uploading and ChartJs data visualization.
